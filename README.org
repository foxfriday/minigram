* ~Minigram~: A minimal grammar checker

This package uses a local instance of [[https://languagetool.org/][LanguageTool]] to check errors. It aims to be as
simple as possible. It has no dependencies other than Java and an instance of ~LanguageTool~
which can be downloaded from their [[https://internal1.languagetool.org/snapshots/][server]]. The package treats grammatical check as a
compilation of language. Checks are not done in real time, but once the text is finished.
I find that sequence far less distracting.

** Similar Packages

[[https://github.com/valentjn/ltex-ls][Ltex-ls]] provides a language server compatible with ~Eglot~, and capable of parsing various
mark up languages. But I never managed to make it work with a configuration file, either
in the command line or as a server.
